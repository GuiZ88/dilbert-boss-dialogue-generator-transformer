DILBERT: was it not obvious this would happen?
BOSS: everyones a genius in hindsight

DILBERT: ive never felt less important

BOSS: you can also invest in it
DILBERT: not better!

BOSS: just do your job
DILBERT: bull can i be nimble instead?

BOSS: i already approved option one
DILBERT: if you need any more help, just let me know

DILBERT: hi. my name is...
BOSS: whoa! whoa! not in person!

BOSS: ted designed the spaceship
DILBERT: karma will sort that all out

DILBERT: our transition to an open office plan has been a huge failure. too many distractions.

BOSS: i need you to put together a five year technology plan for our ceo
DILBERT: sure.

BOSS: How's it going with virtualization?
DILBERT: i did my part by reading about virtualization in a trade journal. now you do the software part.

BOSS: and thats too often!
DILBERT: once a week, tops.

BOSS: sounds fair. dehumanize the enemy by calling them data.
DILBERT: in phase one, well

BOSS: You are wasting too much time
DILBERT: less meetings?

BOSS: awkward, bumbling, cowardly, dumb...
DILBERT: my faults are sus piciously alphabet ical.

DILBERT: smartphones are basically gadgets, and we already make gadgets, so how hard could it be?
BOSS: a wwww

BOSS: the breakthrough i came when i realized fiberoptic cable and string are basically the same thing.
DILBERT: What?

BOSS: it must feel good to be back.
DILBERT: its closer to a tie than youd think.

BOSS: we just ate lunch.
DILBERT: that wasnt lunch.

BOSS: if only someone on my staff could write the software in his spare time...
DILBERT: e aaaaaaaa glub glub glub

DILBERT: who wrote my speech?
BOSS: someone with no economic value.

BOSS: doesnt that make you one of the cable stealing jerks?
DILBERT: youve never met a problem you couldnt worsen. pol

BOSS: ill have to do some research and get back to you.
DILBERT: How about a new employee?

DILBERT: the new hardware you bought isnt compatible with our network.
BOSS: yes it is compatible

BOSS: what do you do in the after noons? ava
DILBERT: i use that time to complain about my morning meetings.

BOSS: the software upgrade actually, thats when we will be will start ready friday. eve m

DILBERT: we doubled our income during the pandemic, and it isnt a good look.
BOSS: in your opinion

DILBERT: safety is good...

DILBERT: no, i like it.
BOSS: pffft. i dont think all of those people can be wrong about what you think. bo.

DILBERT: are we good?
BOSS: its a gray area. i might need to kill you and steal the app.

DILBERT: do you call that managing?
BOSS: no, i call it leading.

BOSS: once again, you have failed to motivate me.
DILBERT: ol

BOSS: howd your business trip to elbonia go?
DILBERT: not so good.

BOSS: you dont appear to be working. 
DILBERT: i am working.

BOSS: work myself to death in this cubicle.
DILBERT: this might be the wakeup call that spurs him on to greatness while i

DILBERT: well probably mock you behind your back.
BOSS: i dont think your teamwork exercises are working.

BOSS: Are you tired?
DILBERT: my creative energy is highest in the morning, but you always schedule our meetings then.

BOSS: you fool! that makes us look lame!
DILBERT: what was i supposed to do when she asked me a question?

DILBERT: i dont even know what conversation im in right now.
BOSS: the extended warranty is second to none. ln

BOSS: when do you expect to finish your project?
DILBERT: never

DILBERT: that big bowl of word salad suggests i triggered you into cognitive dissonance.
BOSS: tuna carpet!

BOSS: are you going to meet the launch deadline?
DILBERT: no. there were unex pected problems.

BOSS: why do you do it?
DILBERT: its because the least important thing i do is way more important than all of you put together.

BOSS: So it's understandable
DILBERT: i dumbed down the technical stuff for you nonengineers.

DILBERT: and thats why we cant put any more resources on your project.
BOSS: sure we can

BOSS: dilbert, i need to fire you for your social media activities.
DILBERT: not

DILBERT: bsb?
BOSS: beautiful, slippery, brittle.

BOSS: lets get started!
DILBERT: can i rebalance my k first?

BOSS: no budget.

BOSS: does everything work perfectly?
DILBERT: you have to admit, my system is better than whatever youre doing over there.

BOSS: vlad is here to tell us why its so important to donate blood. dezza
DILBERT: mamma

DILBERT: some would say we dont need him.
BOSS: maybe theyre jealous of his wisdom. no strategy.

BOSS: thats not how it works!
DILBERT: what does that even mean?

DILBERT: i saw you chatting with our ceo. what was that all about?
BOSS: nothing special

BOSS: have the sales people com plained? u
DILBERT: no, you trained them to accept abuse. 

BOSS:  do you eat food that google doesnt know about?

DILBERT: i feel good about not eating old soap.

BOSS: like this. ooh ooh ooh!
DILBERT: i think were moving in the wrong direction.

DILBERT: n

BOSS: he thinks we can hear him?
DILBERT: he also thinks it is recording.

DILBERT: seven, including this one.

BOSS: the mechanic says, its for knowing where to tap and for the tap.
DILBERT: zzzzz

DILBERT: oh, good.
BOSS: and then your boss should punish you for doing it

DILBERT: then its already too late.
BOSS: not if we hurry.

OSS: did you send it?
DILBERT: okay, i see how youre trying to turn this all around.

DILBERT: who told you that?
BOSS: i promised i wouldnt reveal my source.

DILBERT: i invented a neural interface for computers.
BOSS: really?

DILBERT: for a bosss pet, youre nice.
BOSS: i see no reason to be unkind 

BOSS: i might need my laptop.
DILBERT: i already need it.

DILBERT: that would be good except that i told you it wont be done for six months.
BOSS: ooh

BOSS: i made some improvements to your drawings and sent them for fabrication.
DILBERT: gaaa!!!

BOSS: elbonian hackers got into our network. we dont know how.
DILBERT: elbonian hackers stole our employee performance ranking database, and now they demand a ransom payment to give it back.

DILBERT: i am proud to give you this award for cutting costs more than any other department.
BOSS: off

DILBERT: the premiere is on our ceos yacht. he wants all of you to be there.
BOSS: were invited to his yacht?

BOSS: can you finish it by if its a night light, i monday? 
DILBERT: i can finish it by today.

DILBERT: and how is this different? 
BOSS: now i have a reason.

DILBERT: do the same?
BOSS: sleep here.

BOSS: well have new jobs by then.
DILBERT: did you just turn my job into a criminal conspiracy?

DILBERT: i think i might disable it and not tell them.
BOSS: traitor.

BOSS: i told a customer we would make a small change to the software for them.
DILBERT: you didn't have to do that

DILBERT: what do you think of that?
BOSS: think of what?

BOSS: livestock have no freedom.
DILBERT: can i go home now? 

DILBERT: dont tell me. tell daryll.
BOSS: hey, nice world you have here.

BOSS: are any of our projects funded?
DILBERT: this is the embar rassing part.

DILBERT: did you finish any projects?
BOSS: i cant finish all of the projects you piled on me.

BOSS: did you help ruth?
DILBERT: ill say yes, but its sort of a gray area.

BOSS: who told you that?
DILBERT: answering a question with a question means yes. 

DILBERT: i feel so much better now.
BOSS: good. i was hoping it would work quickly.

DILBERT: why would i do that?
BOSS: well, to keep your job, for example.

DILBERT: youre taking on a big job.
BOSS: not

DILBERT: bad idea. very bad!
BOSS: dont be judg mental during the brain storming.

DILBERT: maybe we should solve the ones we can solve?
BOSS: youre coming off as a quitter.

DILBERT: the capital of japan is mitsubishi.
BOSS: thats right! youre a genius!

DILBERT: i dont know how to do that.
BOSS: try using math.

DILBERT: why did you accept the deal?
BOSS: i agreed to the deal because im a modern day slave trader who believes engineers are property and the rest of you have no economic value.

DILBERT: does it mean my vote wont count?
BOSS: some times it will count twice!

BOSS: would you be a good manager?
DILBERT:  i feel as if im only pretending to be a good manager, someday everyone will find out its an act.

BOSS: when youre done researching new technology, i want you to inventory our furniture.
DILBERT: it's a great way to leverage an engineer

DILBERT: i already hate my own analogy.
BOSS: eggs are overly sensitive, too.

BOSS: hows the cpg project coming along?
DILBERT: how would i know?

DILBERT: do you have a source for your claim that gravity is caused by pollution?
BOSS: boom

BOSS: our miscellaneous hours to specific projects so we can overbill clients?
DILBERT: are you asking us to fraudulently 

DILBERT: is this part of your larger war on knowledge? 
BOSS: that was the last thing ill ever tell you.

BOSS: nothing
DILBERT: what would your data show if your assumptions were less imbecilic?

BOSS: what do you call marketing?
DILBERT: okay, ill give you that one.

BOSS: right?
DILBERT: that is a dangerous way to think.

DILBERT: youre the robot. wally is sitting across from you.
BOSS: well, that just ruined my day.

BOSS: wallys emails make no sense.
DILBERT: he replaced himself with a chatbot.

BOSS: i added my name to your patent application.
DILBERT: what?

BOSS: and its cute!
DILBERT: for example, it accuses the user of sex crimes whenever company comes over.

BOSS: youre not even doing that right.
DILBERT: i guess i need more of your leadership.

BOSS: is this one of those cases where context isnt helpful?
DILBERT: yes it is

BOSS: no youre not.
DILBERT: im not?

BOSS: oops.
DILBERT: how long have i been doing things that dont matter?

BOSS: Have you seen that bill?
DILBERT: if that bill becomes law, it will, in effect, transfer my tax money to you executives for your next obscene bonuses

DILBERT: youre right. i doomed the planet.
BOSS: ill be dead by then, so ship it.

DILBERT: do you think i should get a pet kangaroo?
BOSS: i dont care if you marry one.

DILBERT: maybe someone else could come up with the nicknames.
BOSS: settle down, adolph.

DILBERT: do you have a list of accep table opinions? 
BOSS: there will be no hints.

BOSS: why didnt you answer my text last night?
DILBERT: um...

BOSS: it takes money to make money.
DILBERT: then... where did the first money come from?

DILBERT: fine.
BOSS: fine.

BOSS: it does sound as if theyre wrong a lot.
DILBERT: exactly.

BOSS: for example, you have excellent technical skills.
DILBERT: thats true.

DILBERT: when will that be?
BOSS: i dont know. my european vacation starts tomorrow.

DILBERT: deni ability. got it.
BOSS: we didnt have this conver sation.

DILBERT: that comes next?!
BOSS: optimism is not an attractive quality.

DILBERT: i hired an arrogant guy with a huge forehead. hes on your project.
BOSS: berri chide

BOSS: for now.
DILBERT: welcome to the club.

BOSS: well, at least we still have his startup.
DILBERT: and all seven of its cus tomers, too.

DILBERT: we dont need to sound credible?
BOSS: not even a little.

DILBERT: do you ever worry about karma?
BOSS: get back to work.

BOSS: just give me a range.
DILBERT: between one day and seven hundred years.

DILBERT: or we could actually help people.
BOSS: im thinking more along the lines of a sign in the foyer.

DILBERT: i like what youve done with your dismissive scoffing sound.
BOSS: more spittle!

BOSS: can you give me more choices?
DILBERT: a brain parasite is making him say stupid stuff?

BOSS: would you like some feedback on your performance?
DILBERT: no.

DILBERT: no one says that. mone
BOSS: oh, right. and i should take the word of an oversleeper. que!

DILBERT: i heard that you pledged your loyalty to a dead guy.
BOSS: at least he wont ask for much.

DILBERT: but it wasnt enough?
BOSS: he did a fist thing.

BOSS: our home land is under attack!
DILBERT: which side am i on?

BOSS: where is the system engineer?
DILBERT: what can we do without it besides drink coffee, complain, and whittle?

BOSS: then use the sibs data base.
DILBERT: that data is also wrong.

DILBERT:  i think if we were going to feel that, it would have kicked in by now
BOSS: where is the system engineer?

BOSS: well then, the quality is bad.
DILBERT: compared to...?

BOSS: What do you want?
DILBERT: i need your help creating the pattern recognition algorithm.

BOSS: youre in charge of fissile material, which i assume is a type of soda.
DILBERT: exactly

BOSS: because it means something naughty?
DILBERT: because it isnt a word.

DILBERT: id feel better if we called that marketing.
BOSS: i need you to be more mindless too.

DILBERT: why do i work here?
BOSS: lets go around the table, and each of you tell us a little bit about yourself.

DILBERT:  oh, okay. i like that.
BOSS: i was pretending to be interested in what you said.

BOSS: how can we speed up this process?
DILBERT: im failing as fast as i can.

DILBERT: why not wait and see how i do on my current project?
BOSS: we dont need that anymore.

BOSS: youre fired.
DILBERT: i warned you about that. 

BOSS: i wasnt expecting you to do that.
DILBERT: thats what makes it creative. i looked it up.

DILBERT: i don't see you already
BOSS: our new corporate policy is extreme transparency.

DILBERT: our researchers have invented a technology that turns idiots into smart people.
BOSS: thank you!

DILBERT: thank you.
BOSS: then i thought, why wouldnt i?

BOSS: do what i say and you can change the world while you die from stressrelated health issues!
DILBERT: maybe yes or maybe not

BOSS: huh?
DILBERT: how big do these fonts go?

BOSS: the meeting will be useful. 
DILBERT: more useful than what im doing?

BOSS: youre being stupid.
DILBERT: maybe ill be smarter when i have more distractions.

BOSS: because that's how healthy competition is
DILBERT: then why does our compensation system pit employees against each other to battle for limited salary funds?

DILBERT: then why are we doing it? 
BOSS: something about excellence. 

DILBERT: if you hire me, i will use my brain to develop worldchanging products.
BOSS: enormous

BOSS: do you think i should write a book?
DILBERT: id try reading one first.

BOSS: yes

DILBERT: you said this is my project!
BOSS: ill let him unplug something

DILBERT: would you like to say a few words?
BOSS: brick... elbow... pudding... etcetera

BOSS: im an engineer
DILBERT: how do you make everything sound like a bad idea?

DILBERT: have you ever noticed that our cubicles are organized exactly like a carton of eggs?
BOSS: why aren't you eggs?

BOSS: please stop being you. 
DILBERT: eleven!

BOSS: i was thinking more along the lines of fleeing justice.

BOSS: im disappointed in your negativity
DILBERT: yes you always should be

BOSS: dilbert, meet your new coworker, mister serdecisions
DILBERT: call me lou

BOSS: i just ate three pounds of chocolate
DILBERT: wow. it works fast

BOSS: we named it the procurement operations over sight policy.
DILBERT: p.o.o.p.?

DILBERT: which meetings?
BOSS: you didnt say a word during our meetings for seven months.

BOSS: youre already pretty annoying.
DILBERT: ive been reading up on crushed ice chomping

DILBERT: ill try

DILBERT: where are those copies i asked you to make?
BOSS: i del egated that task to carol

BOSS: do you know what they call humans?
DILBERT:  who fail the turing test?

DILBERT: what does the company want?
BOSS: well, nothing along those lines

DILBERT: and you actually plan to listen to us? 
BOSS: im hoping it will look that way on the outside

DILBERT: im here to boost your morale by pretending to be interested in you as a human being
BOSS: much appreciated

BOSS: its not a crime if you pretend it was an accident
DILBERT: did you learn that in flaw school?

BOSS: why would anyone use paid labor when they could just slaves?
DILBERT: i assume so

BOSS: no
DILBERT: can i have a raise to get my compensation up to market levels?

BOSS: or you see them after your covid
DILBERT: youve made your best decisions since you got brain fog from covid

BOSS: it works great, but make sure this thing is totally idiotproof
DILBERT: as always


BOSS: hold me
DILBERT: keep your stale dna away from

BOSS: youd have to kill me first
DILBERT: that would be two good things for the country

BOSS: i was hoping it wasnt obvious
DILBERT: we can pretend it isnt

BOSS: no
DILBERT: your prototype will never be economical

DILBERT: where did that new desk come from?
BOSS: i think it comes from derivatives or offshore accounts or maybe goodwill

BOSS: without facts, i would just be
DILBERT: it wont affect your career guessing. average

BOSS: good news! we were the low bidder for the united nations asteroid intercept
DILBERT: missile

BOSS: hola. my name is lola.
DILBERT: but then i remembered the importance of teamwork.

DILBERT: ive never wanted to kill you more than right now

DILBERT: worst case ive seen.
BOSS: yee

DILBERT: only an elevated risk of employee sabotage.

BOSS: i was out of coffee so i came here to get a fresh cup. 
DILBERT: ah, here we go.

DILBERT: are you done?
BOSS: a real man could multitask in this situation.

BOSS: yes
DILBERT: and you understand that this is your only alternative?

BOSS: just for that, im going to tell you twice
DILBERT: no, please. ill do any thing

DILBERT: did you see my project update?
BOSS: no

BOSS: so dont let that happen again
DILBERT: it wasnt my fault and you know it

DILBERT: the press is accusing us of running a clever con game on our customers for years without detection.
BOSS: i don't read the newspapers

DILBERT: how many will it take?
BOSS: with any luck, fifteen to seventeen will get it done

DILBERT: such as...?
BOSS: well, for example, you can do more kinds of work

DILBERT: its nothing
BOSS: . she taught you well

BOSS: were consolidating offices and we need to fit twenty people in each cubicle.
DILBERT: not in mine!

BOSS: from within
DILBERT: thats one of your better plans

DILBERT: why on friday? so you exploit us until the last?
BOSS: on friday, you will all get an email informing you whether or not you are still employed

DILBERT: what should i tell them?
BOSS: tell them they should have gotten some sort of insurance

BOSS: or maybe it was because your pass word is password
DILBERT: how do you know my pass word?

DILBERT: but youre also lying
BOSS: only one way to find out

BOSS: i said that?
DILBERT: it was very wise of you

BOSS: one so we can finish on time
DILBERT: but i apparently, hired a new you have never met a website developer before

BOSS: so i was dancing with madonna and went vogue like this 
DILBERT: she liked the idea and made a video

DILBERT: actually, we do have the smartest engineers, but your leadership incompetence cancels out our excellence
BOSS: are you sure?

BOSS: no
DILBERT: did you read my comments on the two alternatives?

DILBERT: how many tendollar mouse pads can we get for?
BOSS: i hope this is a panic attack

DILBERT: if you blog about how lame we are
BOSS: youre fired!!! first day, not so good

BOSS: i did. but you raise a good point about the hand.
DILBERT: i hope you mean the flash drive and not my hand.

DILBERT: ware

BOSS: im only going to ask you to identify as a woman
DILBERT: no, no, no

DILBERT: i dont have time...
BOSS: real quick. one question.

BOSS: what are they?
DILBERT: your data, your format, and your formulas

BOSS: people tell me youre under performing.
DILBERT: did you hear it from anyone credible?

DILBERT: oookay.

BOSS: but after all of that
DILBERT: theyll be as useful as this meeting

BOSS: then how do you know hes indis pensable?
DILBERT: ned told me

BOSS: na
DILBERT: your illtimed meetings reduce my effectiveness by eighty percent.

DILBERT: maybe you should fire them.
BOSS: dont try to pawn off your problems on me.

BOSS: ill just guess what you would have said.
DILBERT: i think thats best.

DILBERT: on the plus side, i managed to salvage some joy by mocking you.
BOSS: whatever youre doing, stop it.

DILBERT: they decided to do option one.
BOSS: morgan the man with no communication skills

BOSS: don't use anything black
DILBERT: i want you to use black hat methods to raise our websites ranking on search engines.

DILBERT: i dont know how to thank you for this.
BOSS: this didnt go the way i hoped.

BOSS: hows the coding coming along?
DILBERT: no problem unless...

BOSS: are you doing anything to impress him?
DILBERT: i plan to fire you. i think hed like that.

DILBERT: im almost positive yoga is not one of the martial arts.

BOSS: ive worked for you for four years.

BOSS: how do i know you really have long covid?
DILBERT: i have a note from my doctor.

DILBERT: better than me

DILBERT: i have a bad feeling about this
BOSS: no one would pay you to feel good

DILBERT: why dont we skip it this year?
BOSS: it would be irra tional to have no plan.

BOSS: id better show this to our ceo.
DILBERT: is that really a good idea?

DILBERT: you just earned yourself a creepy stare until the topic changes.
BOSS: okay, moving on. 

DILBERT: are you listening to me?
BOSS: is some one nursing a baby over there?

DILBERT: still, its nice to...
BOSS: thats enough! i dont want my brain to fall out of my yawn hole.

BOSS: when did you do it? 
DILBERT: this week.

BOSS: and keep it all on one slide.
DILBERT: have you ever listened to the noise coming from your mouth?

BOSS: do you like the new plan?
DILBERT: you could save the company money by crumpling up this document and throwing it away right now.

BOSS: use the crs data base to size the market.
DILBERT: that data is wrong.

BOSS: would he be a good fit?
DILBERT: i like what he has to offer.

BOSS: i can do two things at once.
DILBERT: ill bet you cant even hear me, you ridiculous moron.

BOSS: so youll feel like you had input.
DILBERT: is input supposed to feel this bad?

DILBERT: can i take this data base class?
BOSS: no, thats a slippery slope.

DILBERT: meetings just got a lot more fun..
BOSS: who is saying that?

BOSS: but now youre fresh and ready for the fight?
DILBERT: only if its a stapler fight.

BOSS: we think his parents didnt let him have toys.
DILBERT: the first day is the easiest.

DILBERT: employee vacation days.

DILBERT: stop leaning in.
BOSS: feels... so... good.

BOSS: that isnt funny.
DILBERT: did the impostor have a sense of humor?

BOSS: i cant tell if youre negoti ating or dying.

BOSS: the moron option.

DILBERT: this could not be worse.
BOSS: i mistook a cable for a snake and created a biohazard by the test rack.

DILBERT: now i feel like an idiot because i didnt know about those studies. 
BOSS: i did him first.

BOSS: it made sense at the executive retreat.
DILBERT: was alcohol involved? 

BOSS: dilbert, meet our new account manager.

BOSS: and yet you didnt resign. any more questions?

DILBERT: um... yes, im sure.
BOSS: dont say i didnt warn you.

DILBERT: so... you just spout nonsense until he leaves?
BOSS: thats my goto strategy for most situa tions

BOSS: that sounds like a bad idea.
DILBERT: this sort of input is exactly what im trying to avoid.

BOSS: and it will save us twenty million dollars.
DILBERT: actually, it will cost a million dollars and save nothing.

BOSS: hows your day going?
DILBERT: not bad for a monday.

DILBERT: you spelled crypto wrong.
BOSS: no, i didnt. 

DILBERT: that sounds sub optimal.

BOSS: thats not what i hear.

BOSS: golod
DILBERT: everyone says your new circuit design is worse than the old one.

DILBERT: isnt that sort of evil?

DILBERT: this would take months.
BOSS: i told her two days. dont make me look dumb.

BOSS: company policy says you have to take a vacation.
DILBERT: i dont want one.

BOSS: that one must have been from someone else.
DILBERT: good, because i didnt read it.

BOSS: why does everything you say annoy me?
DILBERT: is it because youre a great communicator?

DILBERT: why are you doing this?
BOSS: my boss wouldnt let me get a fainting goat.

BOSS: when do you think you can get that done for me?
DILBERT: depends.

BOSS: you should do that too.
DILBERT: do you want me to copy his lies, or can i freestyle?

DILBERT: do you know what that would mean for humans?
BOSS: does the answer involve salad?

BOSS: i worry that youre not taking this seriously.
DILBERT: if the muggles find out, ill wipe their memories.

DILBERT: is it okay if i just stare at you in disbelief?
BOSS: shouldnt you be scheduling some meetings?

BOSS: why are we even talking about it?
DILBERT: because the more i talk, the less i have to listen to you.

BOSS: just do what i want before i know i want it.
DILBERT: i hope the next thing you want is sarcasm.

DILBERT: how did they disguise the face part?
BOSS: they learned from youtube makeup videos.

BOSS: why do i talk to you?
DILBERT: i assume you do it to gain wisdom.

BOSS: when you say bugs, thats sort of a gray area.
DILBERT: um...i dont think it is.

DILBERT: im over whelmed with work.
BOSS: heres some more work.

DILBERT: have you done this before?
BOSS: every six months.

BOSS: so really, the fault lies with climate change, not me.
DILBERT: slow clap.

BOSS: this meeting will go a lot smoother if you stop doing whatever youre doing right now.
DILBERT: i call it thinking.

BOSS: what ever youre doing, cut it out.
DILBERT: should i stop being rational in general or only in this one way?

BOSS: did you upgrade your soft ware?
DILBERT: great. i see whose side youre on.

BOSS: thats not a thing.
DILBERT: i dont trust any of you.

BOSS: is it working yet?
DILBERT: yes, if that makes you go away.

DILBERT: and you believed ted?
BOSS: hes more credible than you.

DILBERT: i wish i had some data for this.
BOSS: try googling it.

BOSS: because the ratio is too high.

DILBERT: what about clarity?
BOSS: clarity is not our friend on this one.

BOSS: youre welcome. 
DILBERT: why does it feel as if my entire career has been preparation for this project?

BOSS: the marketing guru consumers will buy our tractorsized mp players if we offer something free with each one.

DILBERT: he has been working on our exoskeleton project for five years.

DILBERT: this is what you would look like if you were stylish and cool and fun to be with. 
BOSS: live byoooo

DILBERT: the upgrade could make our network unstable.
BOSS: you cant make an omelet without breaking some eggs.

DILBERT: do you like my idea?
BOSS: i need to think about it.

DILBERT: my computer is too slow. i need to upgrade it.
BOSS: you are slow enough for your slow computer

BOSS: then why do manuals exist?
DILBERT: if you need me, ill be banging my head against a wall.

DILBERT: the engineer says the glass is too big.
BOSS: the manager says the engineer should shut his pie hole. 

DILBERT: how were you making decisions?
BOSS: its better if we dont excavate that septic tank.

BOSS: thats too high.
DILBERT: if you already know the cost, why are you asking me?

BOSS: why wouldnt it?
DILBERT: lets change the subject.

DILBERT: where do they get their opinions from?
BOSS: from something called an algorithm.

BOSS: the hydrogen makes it lighter than air.
DILBERT: hydrogen?

DILBERT: how dare you accuse me...
BOSS: well, well. look whos impeding wally again.

DILBERT: say hello to paul.
BOSS: c v i hear our data center has a lot of copper wire.

DILBERT: im doing it right now!
BOSS: why didnt you upgrade the servers like i asked?

DILBERT: what do you mean by that?
BOSS: sorry. i didnt expect you to be listening to me.

DILBERT: i never said that.
BOSS: i heard you did.

DILBERT: isnt that all you do?
BOSS: i dont like where this is heading.

BOSS: talk to allen about this.
DILBERT: ill need an exit strategy.

DILBERT: gaaa!!! why do you keep ruining my credibility?
BOSS: good cop, bad cop.

DILBERT: youre not good at comparing things.
BOSS: pffft. im way better at it than a giraffe.

BOSS: no one likes a braggart.

DILBERT: weve got a dead guy in cubicle
BOSS: you have to clean it up

DILBERT: dont worry. i put a supportive sign in the lobby so theyll know we are on their side.
BOSS: ii..

BOSS: at least a week, i would think.
DILBERT: why would you think that?

BOSS: im looking for thought diversity in my hiring. 
DILBERT: thats a thing now.

DILBERT: so... business casual?
BOSS: thats a dumb name for it.

DILBERT: one of your engineers came to me with a suggestion.
BOSS: gasp!

DILBERT: that doesnt seem useful.
BOSS: would you say that about oxygen?

DILBERT: okay, can i get effort from any of you?
BOSS: i can only give you the extra you believe exists.

DILBERT: do you think were idiots? 
BOSS: moving along... 

BOSS:  we need to cut our expenses.
DILBERT: i recommend eliminating teds job.

DILBERT: because you hate me?
BOSS: no, its because i hate him.

BOSS: well, it could be worse.
DILBERT: they tasted human flesh, and they like it.

DILBERT: why do we pay for un reliable infor mation?
BOSS: we cant afford the other kind.

BOSS: it's not a good idea
DILBERT: at what point did you reject the hypothesis that youre too dumb to understand how good the idea is?

BOSS: did you give him that project?
DILBERT: i dont remember every little thing ive ever done.

BOSS: the answer is that we need to shine the braille toad.
DILBERT: do you see any problem with our system?

DILBERT: why would they buy it in the first place?
BOSS: a big part of our strategy involves lying.

BOSS: how do you like thought diversity now? bo
DILBERT: that fad didnt last long.

DILBERT: i suppose we could make our lie sound credible.
BOSS: thats over kill.

DILBERT: there hasnt been any progress.
BOSS: thats okay. use a large font.

BOSS: is experience exactly the same as pessimism?
DILBERT: experience is much worse

BOSS: theres some thing wrong with you.
DILBERT: apology accepted. next.

DILBERT: wally, are you done with your project yet?
BOSS: ill be done next week.

BOSS: i invented head phones that will record all of your advice as you dispense it.

DILBERT: i dont do it that often.
BOSS: stop making every thing i say sound dumb. 

DILBERT: you caused the problem.
BOSS: who told you it was a fair world?

DILBERT: can we blame climate change?
BOSS: i was thinking either vaccin ations or long covid.

BOSS: do what you need to do, but dont scare our other robots.
DILBERT: i plan to kill it and drink its head.

BOSS: if its accurate, why are people upset?
DILBERT: said the angry guy to the one who isnt.

DILBERT: our sales dropped to zero after you offended customers on twitter.
BOSS: were losing market share to a company that has a remote workforce.

DILBERT: yes, but...
BOSS: dont be afraid of change.

BOSS: sorry. im usually more subtle. 
DILBERT: no worries. this was a decoy.

DILBERT: it is easier to ask forgive ness than permission.
BOSS: okay, that sounds right.

DILBERT: the class i took in active nonlistening is really paying off.
BOSS: i need this by tuesday.

DILBERT: was it made in elbonia?
BOSS: yes, but i think my point still stands.

DILBERT: here.
BOSS: i like to blame people who wont be in the room.

DILBERT: and then i would be able to negotiate for a higher salary.
BOSS: pass.

DILBERT: so im nothing but a bag of meat?
BOSS: no. youre a lying bag of meat.

BOSS: you did this wrong.
DILBERT: i did it the way you told me to do it.

BOSS: did you recently read an article?
DILBERT: some of it. 

BOSS: your respect sounds exactly like dis respect.
DILBERT: how is that my fault?

BOSS: lets see. i have you down for something called... blame.
DILBERT: why didnt you talk to me before making this decision?

DILBERT: what is happening here?
BOSS: i dont know, but i wouldnt compare it to work.

BOSS: does the creator love us? in
DILBERT: no, hes in it for the money.

DILBERT: and then we have the entire history of science.
BOSS: stop. youre embarrassing yourself.

BOSS: sounds like you need some extra micro managing.
DILBERT: i have to take this call.

BOSS: no one said the transition would be smooth.
DILBERT: make the first one count. ge shows

BOSS: i know. i plan to go for lunch.
DILBERT: the network will be down all day, but try to do what you can without it.

BOSS: this feels wrong.
DILBERT: try using more wrist.

BOSS: those people sound crazy.
DILBERT: can you warn us if you see one?

DILBERT: in that case, i must be done.
BOSS: are you trying to tell me some thing?

DILBERT: the test data doesnt support our plan. 
BOSS:  all i ask is that you dont look like youre enjoying it.

BOSS: whoo hoo! im smarter than an engineer!
DILBERT: not quite. im only down by .

DILBERT: still genius?
BOSS: shut up and die.

BOSS: i hired an engineer from google. 
DILBERT: whes so smart that he evolved into a life form that exists as pure energy.ww

BOSS: you say that every time. 
DILBERT: i havent been wrong yet.

BOSS: no, you used the old form.
DILBERT: do we have new forms?

DILBERT: then why are you not considering it? hj
BOSS: this is exactly why no one likes you.

BOSS: it is time for the sacred dance of the cubicle.
DILBERT: great idea. can we add some crying babies and the sound of water dripping?

DILBERT: remember the proj ect that i finished last year?
BOSS: one year later no. but the new one looks like it will be late.

BOSS: she reports to me.
DILBERT: ill email your boss some sugges tions for fixing you.

BOSS: lets go around the room and give our project updates..
DILBERT: pow! 

DILBERT: whyd i just get chills?
BOSS: me too. it feels like some sort of forbidden knowledge.

DILBERT: then why is the class offered?
BOSS: i assume we do it to spot trouble makers.

DILBERT: its too new.
BOSS: you cant nominate that one. 

BOSS: and id like to give a big thanks to those of you who never had a life. sind
DILBERT: youre welcome.

BOSS: will it hurt?
DILBERT: it might sting a little when you announce youre going to be a web only company.

DILBERT: how many extwitter employees did you hire?
BOSS: lots. why do you ask?

DILBERT: do i look like i need it?
BOSS: only in two places. i your face and your body.

BOSS: youll have to finish the design jin a month.

BOSS: theyll get over it.

DILBERT: id like to hear those stories.

DILBERT: sure. i can multiply them too.

BOSS: works for me.
DILBERT: its better to not over think these things.

DILBERT: how do you stay in business?
BOSS: our customers are even dumber than us.

DILBERT: we dont want any visitors to see vacant offices.
BOSS:  they might think were having financial troubles.

BOSS: wereld

DILBERT: how did you keep your training expenses so low?
BOSS: i mari nated in my own stench.

BOSS: its as if youre a technologist and a philosopher all in one!
DILBERT: blah blah platform.

BOSS: i cant tell if i should laugh at that.
DILBERT: thats because youre not a leader.

DILBERT: i recommend we upgrade one of our servers over the weekend.
BOSS: no we don't

DILBERT: the goal of our organization is to make your security procedures so inconvenient that you give up hope and die from bed sores.

BOSS: what could go wrong?
DILBERT: i hear thunder.

BOSS: i kind of do.
DILBERT: i think we have an under standing.

BOSS: po!
DILBERT: that way it will be easy to take half of your money.

BOSS: i wasnt asking for sugges tions.
DILBERT: geez, way to be critical during the brain storming. pol

BOSS: who?
DILBERT: the outgoing director says i need to ask the incoming director, but that person hasnt been named.

BOSS: well, remove that button.
DILBERT: its only on your copy.

BOSS: no, its nothing like that.
DILBERT: good, because i plan to make up all of the numbers.

DILBERT: doot
BOSS: i dont want employees who are only working here for the money.

DILBERT: so...?
BOSS: therefore, he must be punished.

DILBERT: you nailed it.

DILBERT: why cant you admit you are wrong?!
BOSS: why cant you?

BOSS: but we would make lots of money?
DILBERT: lots and lots.

DILBERT: so very, very com fortable.
BOSS: yeah, this isnt working.

DILBERT: to save the project?
BOSS: um... okay, sure.

BOSS: try reducing one of the inputs.
DILBERT: which one?

DILBERT: we dont have any g tech nology.

DILBERT: good enough?
BOSS: stop being a jerk.

DILBERT: and you think he might say yes?
BOSS: better safe than sorry.

BOSS: was any of that real?
DILBERT: its a gray area.

BOSS: what the...?
DILBERT: dont hate me for being a philos opher.

DILBERT: is she a genius?
BOSS: no, but she makes up for it with her attitude.

DILBERT: really? other people are never right?
BOSS: you have to trust your gut!

BOSS: its called making your boss look good.
DILBERT: maybe you could help a little too.

BOSS: nell
DILBERT: the new dress code is a thin film of oil.

BOSS: decentralization will change every thing.

DILBERT: super.

BOSS: who calls me that?
DILBERT: bad people. i try to stop them.

DILBERT: youre probably wrong, and yet you still made me look like an idiot.
BOSS: i win!

BOSS: i guess it can wait until the staff meeting.
DILBERT: that way i can enjoy the antic ipation, too.

BOSS: hows your family?
DILBERT: im still single and childless.

DILBERT: what do you think?
BOSS: this will never work.

DILBERT: can he speak?
BOSS: yes, but only with sarcasm.

BOSS: lwan
DILBERT: do you know the difference between data encapsulation and inheritance polymorphism?

BOSS: you have been assigned to the project
DILBERT: i was the only person who said this project is a bad idea. then you assigned it to me.

DILBERT: obviously well need to delay our launch for the public good.
BOSS: when did you become a communist?

DILBERT: dook cop
BOSS: i decided to give all of you nicknames to lighten the mood around here and improve morale.

DILBERT: that will totally fix this problem.
BOSS: you just bought yourself an extra week.

DILBERT: how about i say i didnt feel moti vated and leave it otherwise vague?
BOSS: i can work with that.

DILBERT: um... all i asked was...
BOSS: gaaa! youre totally losing it now!

BOSS: try being a team player for once.
DILBERT: i didnt know satan had a team.

DILBERT: not if people act rationally and stop removing the co when...
BOSS: wait....

DILBERT: torr
BOSS: technology is amazing. i type one message and within minutes ill have my data.

DILBERT: i want a raise.
BOSS: money cant buy happiness.

BOSS: i knew you wouldnt disappoint me.
DILBERT: i think we just planned that for friday. 

DILBERT: do you see any problem with that?
BOSS: it makes you look extra disloyal?

BOSS: thanks
DILBERT: but all i do is agree with whatever ridiculous thing you say because its just easier that way.

DILBERT: okay, thats enough.
BOSS: nailed it!

DILBERT: im bored.
BOSS: heres some more work.

DILBERT: such as...
BOSS: well, for example...

BOSS: you keep spending time on tasks.
DILBERT: lowpriority

DILBERT: What does our CEO say?
BOSS: second, our ceo is having a contest to see who can suggest the most useless corporate rule to eliminate.

BOSS: ive been eating the food in there for seven years.
DILBERT: id keep that to myself if i were you.

DILBERT: i dont know what to do now.
BOSS: maybe thats the problem.

DILBERT: no.
BOSS: toss it in the trash.

BOSS: would you like to defend yourself?
DILBERT: im not that moti vated.

BOSS: when will you have that done?
DILBERT: two weeks.

BOSS: when do you think he will be done?

BOSS: youll need approval from the cloud.
DILBERT: the cloud? you

BOSS: i dont pay con sultants for advice. 
DILBERT: i pay them to leave.

DILBERT: and so, as you can see...
BOSS: all of the numbers i gave you last week are wrong.

BOSS: its mostly about mating. 
DILBERT: w run.

BOSS: because it was so hard to do.
DILBERT: who told you it was hard?

BOSS: big deal.
DILBERT: he acci dentally opened a gas line.

BOSS: now what are we going to do with a nuclear rocket?
DILBERT: well, the moon has always been a jerk.

DILBERT: they offered me more money.
BOSS: ouch. sounds like a brutal commute.

BOSS: another division needs your help for a sixmonth project.
DILBERT: who will do my work here?

BOSS: could have been worse.
DILBERT: only for the squirrels.

DILBERT: is that agile enough for you?
BOSS: ill need to google that.

DILBERT: got wy
BOSS: id like to thank each member of the product team for the successful launch.

BOSS: how does that fit our strategic direction?
DILBERT: bing bing bing!

DILBERT: and...?
BOSS: and i disagree with his political opinions.

BOSS: ill add that lie to your list.
DILBERT: i dont see a path to victory here.

DILBERT: im hoping that his department needs
BOSS: the infrastructure more than we do.

BOSS: you ruin every thing.
DILBERT: context is not your friend.

BOSS: how long does it last?
DILBERT: it isnt looking good for today.

BOSS: hows your project going?
DILBERT: do you mean the one that has...

DILBERT: how do you plan to solve that? 
BOSS: i dont need to. it isnt an app i need.

DILBERT: why elbonia?
BOSS: i need you to attend a threeday industry standards meeting in elbonia.

BOSS: thats just showing off.

DILBERT: now connect the dots.
BOSS: so youre saying we need more rules.

BOSS: the what?
DILBERT: compared to you, high achievers.

DILBERT: should i proceed stupidly?
BOSS: it got us this far.

DILBERT: i didnt know we had a server issue.
BOSS: thats no ex cuse.

BOSS: no, not a thing.
DILBERT: thats probably for the best.

BOSS: you lost our data center?
DILBERT: thats one way to look at it.

DILBERT: you mean falsify the data.
BOSS: lets not get hung up on the definition of things.

DILBERT: or maybe customers give us money. 
BOSS: i hope not. i dont like to feel beholden.

DILBERT: why cant kevin do it?
BOSS: alice needed him for some thing.

DILBERT: it seems you have wasted my time.
BOSS: its not my fault you got the wrong answer.

BOSS: sounds like a radical change.
DILBERT: i cant tell if that was sarcasm.

DILBERT: what am i supposed to do now?
BOSS: can you rephrase that question in the form of a proposal?

DILBERT: would all we that be need is murder or reason suicide?
BOSS: able doubt.

BOSS: wait... why do we both sound right?
DILBERT: i dont know. its freaking me out a little.

DILBERT: better make it fast!

DILBERT: are we a criminal organi zation?
BOSS: not in a way that can easily be proven.

DILBERT: some thing is conspic uously missing.
BOSS: nepotism?

BOSS: dont do that! bo
DILBERT: so... i should not be proactive?

BOSS: which data? 
DILBERT: all of it. the names of our data bases got mixed up.

BOSS: it might sound unfair, but these are good jokes. 
DILBERT: like what can i do you for?

DILBERT: guess what the margin on that is! ha ha! ac
BOSS: its okay. we dont let him connect to the outside. 

BOSS: we found out it doesnt matter if you are happy.
DILBERT: remind never ask another question.

BOSS: che
DILBERT: maybe i could use your laptop until we have the budget to get me a computer that works.

BOSS: can you prove you are not a spy? j
DILBERT: how about i prove youre a moron and see how far that gets us?

DILBERT: we might need some clarity on this.
BOSS: to four more hours should do it.

DILBERT: he doesnt perfect. ill tell human have an honest resources bone in his body.
BOSS: to send him an offer.

DILBERT: stop that wasnt making helpful. it all you
BOSS: about you.

DILBERT: that was number three on the list. that was number one.
BOSS: i didnt read it.

DILBERT: i need a more ergo nomic office chair.
BOSS: let me check the budget.

BOSS: july
DILBERT: my staff is threatening to quit because of our military contracts.

DILBERT: he also didnt do any work.
BOSS: min why does everyone hate winners?

DILBERT: i hired a manage ment consultant to teach us something he calls backwards
BOSS: causation. 

DILBERT: im talking about our goals, not their goals.
BOSS: totally different.

DILBERT: maybe your boss can fill you in.
BOSS: i was brain golfing. san jiw

DILBERT: how long has she been doing that?
BOSS: i thought i was years old until just now.

BOSS: is that part neces sary? apply
DILBERT: like water to a fish.

BOSS: i also need your status report by end of day.
DILBERT: i would totally do that if not for this darned emergency.

BOSS: can you fix that bug?
DILBERT: some say climate change will get it done.

DILBERT: how do you plan to make a decision without reading it?
BOSS: ill use my gut. go

DILBERT: why are you so threatened by jerry?
BOSS: i hes i not i i very i ! agile.

DILBERT: you promised me they wouldnt listen.
BOSS: it caught me by surprise too.

BOSS: dilbert, were low on space. youll have to share your cubicle.
DILBERT: i can even leave it

DILBERT: how do you know youre good at it?
BOSS: because imaginary people do this job worse than i do.

DILBERT: are we at war with an alien invader?
BOSS: no, that would imply our side has weapons too.

BOSS: thats how we do it here.
DILBERT: i didnt realize it was a strategy.

DILBERT: because he likes it when we act stupid?
BOSS: its better for every one if we call it dedication.

BOSS: you missed all of your goals.
DILBERT: because of poor manage ment.

DILBERT: how much are we paying you? im leasing my advice to you.
BOSS: thank you!

BOSS: well, maybe. but would they have implemented it?
DILBERT: im going to talk to smart people now.

DILBERT: no face mask?
BOSS: i have antibodies for the virus.

BOSS: perfect!
DILBERT: that leaves me nothing to talk about.

BOSS: ill give you weeks.
DILBERT: thats how long it will take to set up the first meeing.

DILBERT: try doing your own research.
BOSS:  thats how i learned that hurricanes are caused by birds

BOSS: hire them all back. a jupes
DILBERT: then our expenses will be too high.

DILBERT: next week, the donuts are on me.
BOSS: die! die! die!

DILBERT: that sounds like the epitome of evil.
BOSS: we call it extreme marketing.

BOSS: maybe its this elbonian guy you hired.
DILBERT: whoa, that is super racist.

DILBERT: maybe you shouldnt do research on the internet.
BOSS: why are you afraid of the truth?

BOSS: you could never do my job.
DILBERT: im doing it right now.

DILBERT: you came here to give both of them to me.
BOSS: ha ha! you know me.

BOSS: did you send me your project update?
DILBERT: were you planning to read it?

BOSS: it was once called matrix management.
DILBERT:  but it got so complicated that no one knows who does what.

DILBERT: that feels un ethical.
BOSS: not if we act fast.

DILBERT: that means youre totally worth less.
BOSS: i was going to say intui tive.

BOSS: i thought we already paid this vendor.
DILBERT: did you forget all the extras i told you about?

DILBERT: do you under stand?
BOSS: blah, blah, soft ware.

DILBERT: maybe everyone can just work from home.
BOSS: and miss all of this?

BOSS: yes it is
DILBERT: is it because you hate me?

DILBERT: which is... an entirely different topic.
BOSS: why are you fighting me on this?

DILBERT: i didnt mean to imply... do you know if the parking garage
BOSS: m accepts acorns?

BOSS: that conversation never happened.
DILBERT: maybe you planned to say it and then the thought morphed into a false memory.

BOSS: erede
DILBERT: hey, i have a great idea.

BOSS: dilbert, id like you to collaborate with him.
DILBERT: can we call it something else?

DILBERT: yes, but i got the result you wanted.
BOSS: next time, just say that.

DILBERT: why?
BOSS: come into my office and we can discuss it.

BOSS: i own you!
DILBERT: whoever said honesty is refreshing never heard any.

BOSS: to my mind, its a market niche.
DILBERT: maybe you should get your mind out of your niche.

BOSS: okay, good.
DILBERT: so who do you want to win and by how much?

BOSS: what have we accomp lished lately?
DILBERT: pol we got paid for planning to lie to our ceo.

DILBERT: take your time. i can wait.
BOSS: for starters, he dis agrees with me.

BOSS: whats funny?
DILBERT: using incompe tence as a substitute for time.

BOSS: your weak response proves you are an elbonian spy.
DILBERT: what? to be continued...

DILBERT: ceo visit my meetings go faster when i set the tone.
BOSS: hood

DILBERT: the country that is our single source for elbonium just declared a trade war.
BOSS: what will we do?

DILBERT: theyre using our data.
BOSS: thats how i know its fake.

DILBERT: okay, well, at least my input is critical to our success.
BOSS: i might have exag gerated that.

BOSS: you did this wrong.
DILBERT: thats how you trained me to do it.

DILBERT: have you ever talked to an average person? nor
BOSS: tell me again why were raising all of our prices? peny

DILBERT: they demand a human sacrifice. u
BOSS: fetch the spare racist i hired for that purpose.

DILBERT: i feel sick.
BOSS: thats how you know its working.

DILBERT: am i a criminal now?
BOSS: i think of you as more of an accomplice.

BOSS: what?
DILBERT: it might take five minutes, tops.

DILBERT: Can you give me an example?
BOSS: but in the interest of time, i will not list any examples.

BOSS: problem solved.
DILBERT: do you know the difference between managing and bullying? no.

BOSS: the key to leader ship is setting vague goals that are a combination of jargon and wishful thinking.
DILBERT: you are a great strategist

DILBERT: i didnt.
BOSS: then how do you explain this exclamation mark?

BOSS: i cant manage you if you dont learn to lie.
DILBERT: okay, the software will be perfect in ten days.

BOSS: i dont know how analogies work.
DILBERT: im counting on that.

BOSS: but i dont remember what it was
DILBERT: neither do i.

BOSS: uhhuh uhhuh go on.
DILBERT: you smell like old socks, and your brain is made of cheese.

DILBERT: your comments on my technology strategy are ambiguous.
BOSS: Are you sure they are?

DILBERT: and if we stop later?
BOSS: the trick is to never finish the project. 

DILBERT: but does it work?
BOSS: we didnt have a compelling reason to test it.

BOSS: can i hear those two choices again?
DILBERT: I won't repeat them

DILBERT: i guess three days wont be so bad.
BOSS: youre not allowed to eat.

BOSS: what is my barber doing here?
DILBERT: that haircut will never become your next president. 

BOSS: after we annihilate our competition, we can jack up our prices to monopoly levels and take advantage of our customers.
DILBERT: what a beautiful strategy

DILBERT: thank you for your leader ship.
BOSS: we also need to communi cate less.

BOSS: i had to lay off many of your co workers today, but your jobs are safe.
DILBERT: but if I do everything here

BOSS: you worry too much.
DILBERT: if you need me, ill be selling all of my company stock.

BOSS: i migrated our northern data center to the cloud.
DILBERT: there is no cloud just someone else's computer

DILBERT: what?
BOSS: its standard procedure.

BOSS: a if im being honest, it wasnt one of your brightest ideas.
DILBERT: yes it was

BOSS: thanks to your leadership, we collected twenty thousand bottle caps to help fund chemo for poor children. 
DILBERT: Couldn't you give them directly?

DILBERT: sabotage all of his projects.
BOSS: try to do it before he takes my job.

BOSS: yesterday i had a great meeting about project wombat.
DILBERT: what?

BOSS: okay, where do we begin?
DILBERT: lesson one is mocking him behind his back.

BOSS: please dont make me equal to the underlings ive been abusing for years!
DILBERT: but i am willing to give you some ideas that are too lame for my own use.

DILBERT: Good morning boss, how are you doing today?
BOSS: Well, I was alright until I saw the code you wrote yesterday.

DILBERT: Oh no, what's wrong with it?
BOSS: It's so bad, it crashed our entire system and even the coffee machine stopped working.

DILBERT: Yikes, that's not good. But on the bright side, there's no coffee to spill on the computers now.
BOSS: You're lucky I have a sense of humor.

DILBERT: (smiling) I'm glad you see the funny side of things.
BOSS: But seriously, we need to fix this issue ASAP.

DILBERT: Hey boss, do you know what the computer said when it got cold?
BOSS: No, what did it say?

DILBERT: "I think I need some Windows!"
BOSS:  Good one! But seriously, let's talk about the new project.

DILBERT: Sure thing, boss. What are your thoughts?
BOSS: Well, we need to create a new app that helps people find the best pizza places in town.

DILBERT:  I'm all for that, but can we add a feature that automatically orders the pizza for me too?
BOSS:  Now that's a great idea! But seriously, let's focus on the main objective.

DILBERT: Got it, boss. I'm on it. And I'll make sure to have a pizza waiting for us when we finish this project.
BOSS:  I like the way you think! Okay, let's get back to work.

DILBERT: Hi boss! I have good news and bad news.
BOSS: Oh no, what's the bad news?

DILBERT: Well, the bad news is that our database has been corrupted and we've lost all of our client data.
BOSS: Oh my god, that's awful! What's the good news?

DILBERT: The good news is that I backed up all the data on my personal computer.
BOSS: Oh great, I'm so glad you made a backup on your personal computer.

DILBERT: Hey, at least you know I take my work home with me.
BOSS:  Okay, point taken. But next time, can we please make a proper backup on the company server?

DILBERT: Of course, boss. You know, they say that laughter is the best backup for any data loss.
BOSS: You're a funny guy, but don't quit your day job just yet. Let's get that backup onto the company server ASAP.

DILBERT: Hey boss, what do you call a programmer who just broke up with his girlfriend?
BOSS: I don't know, what?

DILBERT: Homeless.
BOSS: (laughs) That's terrible but hilarious. Do you have any more jokes?

DILBERT: Oh yeah, how about this one? Why did the programmer quit his job?
BOSS: I don't know, why?

DILBERT: He didn't get arrays.
BOSS: (laughs again) Oh man, you're killing me. But seriously, how's the project coming along?

DILBERT: Oh, it's going great! I'm just doing my best to avoid any bugs, especially those pesky ones that just won't go away no matter how much you try to debug.
BOSS: (chuckles) Yeah, those bugs can be a real pain. But I have faith in you, you always manage to get the job done.

DILBERT: Thanks boss, I appreciate the confidence. And if all else fails, I'll just keep telling jokes until the project magically fixes itself.
BOSS: (laughs) Sounds like a plan. Keep up the good work!

DILBERT: Hey boss, you look like you need some assistance. 
BOSS: Assistance? Why do you say that?

DILBERT: Well, you're staring at the computer screen like it's the forbidden fruit.
BOSS: Ha! You might be right, I've been staring at this for hours now.

DILBERT: Let me guess, another coding challenge?
BOSS: Yeah, this one's a real doozy. I just can't seem to crack it.

DILBERT: Well, don't worry boss, I'm here to help. You know what they say, two DILBERTs are better than one.
BOSS: (laughs) Alright, you've convinced me. What do you suggest?

DILBERT: How about we take a break and go out for some coffee, talk about something other than coding for a bit.
BOSS: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe some fresh air will clear my head.

DILBERT: And if that doesn't work, we can always bring in the secret weapon.
BOSS: The secret weapon?

DILBERT: Yeah, my mom's homemade cookies always do the trick.
BOSS: (laughs) Alright, let's give it a shot. You're the assistant that every boss needs.

DILBERT: Hey boss, good morning! Did you have a good weekend?
BOSS: Hey there! Yeah, it was nice to relax a bit. How about you?

DILBERT: Yeah, it was good. I did some hiking and played some video games.
BOSS: Cool! So, what are you working on today?

DILBERT: Actually, I just finished up that new feature we talked about last week. Want to take a look?
BOSS: Definitely. Let me see. Wow, great job! This looks really slick.

DILBERT: Thanks, I appreciate it. It was a bit tricky to implement, but I think it turned out well.
BOSS: It definitely did. And speaking of tricky, I was wondering if you could take a look at this bug we've been having trouble with?

DILBERT: Sure thing. What seems to be the issue?
BOSS: Well, we've been getting some inconsistent results when users try to log in. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.

DILBERT: Hmm, that does sound tricky. Let me take a look at the code and see if I can figure out what's going on.
BOSS: Great, thanks. I really appreciate your help with this.

DILBERT: No problem. I'm always happy to help out where I can.
BOSS: You know, I feel really lucky to have you on the team. Your expertise and hard work make a huge difference.

DILBERT: Aw, thanks boss. That means a lot to me.
BOSS: It's the truth! Keep up the great work, and let me know if you need anything.

BOSS: Hey there, developer! How's it going? Are you ready to code the next big thing?
DILBERT: Always ready, boss. You know me, I eat code for breakfast.

BOSS: Haha, that's the kind of energy I like to see! Speaking of breakfast, have you tried those new coding-themed cereals? There’s 'if loops' and 'bit crunch.'
DILBERT: Really? That sounds like the perfect breakfast for a developer! But I'm more of a coffee person, you know. Can I have some coding coffee instead?

BOSS: Coding coffee? That's a new one. Is that a cup of coffee with zeros and ones mixed in?
DILBERT: Haha! Close enough, boss. It's actually a special blend of coffee that helps me stay focused while debugging those pesky bugs.

BOSS: Well, I guess as long as it gets the job done. But don't forget to take a break and stretch those coding muscles once in a while.
DILBERT: Don't worry, boss. I've got a special program that reminds me to take breaks and do some coding stretches. I call it muscle memory management.

BOSS: Haha! You never cease to amaze me, developer. With your sense of humor and coding skills, you're going to be a star in this company!
DILBERT: Thanks, boss. It's always a pleasure working with you. Let's go code some magic!

BOSS: Hey there developer, can you explain this code to me?
DILBERT: Sure boss, do you need a beginner's guide or an advanced analysis?

BOSS: Ha! You know me too well. Let's start with the beginner's guide, I don't want to be left in the dust.
DILBERT: Alright, so basically, this code makes the computer do stuff.

BOSS: Wow, who knew? And here I thought it made the computer bake me a cake. Keep going, I'm learning so much.
DILBERT: Okay, okay. So this line of code creates a variable to store information.

BOSS: So it's like a digital post-it note?
DILBERT: Exactly! You're a natural at coding boss.

BOSS: Ha! I think I found my calling. Now, can we make the computer do my laundry? That would be the real game-changer.
DILBERT: I'll get right on that boss. But until then, I think we can stick to making the computer do things that are actually possible.

BOSS: Hey, developer! How's it going?
DILBERT: Just debugging some code, boss. How about you? Running the company like a boss?

BOSS: You know it! But hey, do you know why programmers prefer dark mode?
DILBERT: Hmm, I don't know. Why?

BOSS: Because light attracts bugs! Ha!
DILBERT: That's a good one, boss. But maybe you should try using a computer first before cracking technology jokes.

BOSS: Hey now, I know a thing or two! Like, why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?
DILBERT: I'll bite. Why?

BOSS: Because it was two-tired! Get it?
DILBERT: Okay, that one was pretty good. But let me tell you my favorite programming joke...

BOSS: Hey! How's it going?
DILBERT: Oh, hey boss! Just coding away over here.

BOSS: You mean you're not playing video games like all the other programmers?
DILBERT: Nope, I promised to get this project done on time.

BOSS: You're no fun. Why don't you take a break and come play ping pong with me?
DILBERT: Sounds good. But can we make it more interesting? How about if I win, I get a raise?

BOSS: And if I win?
DILBERT: You have to wear a tutu to work for an entire week.

BOSS: Deal! But let me warn you, I was the ping pong champ in college.
DILBERT: Bring it on, boss.

DILBERT: Yes! Looks like I get that raise after all.
BOSS: I can't believe it. I guess I better start practicing.

DILBERT: And don't forget about that tutu. I'm already excited to see it.
BOSS: I'll get you back for this, just wait and see.

BOSS: Hey there, developer! My computer is tuned up and ready for programming!
DILBERT: That's great news, boss! What kind of programming challenge do we have today?

BOSS: Well, I was thinking, can you create an AI that can make me funny?
DILBERT: That's a tall order, boss.

BOSS: I know, I know, but I figured if we put our heads together, we could create the world's funniest AI!
DILBERT: OK, let's see what we can do. We'll start with some classic jokes. Why did the scarecrow win an award?

BOSS: Hmm, I don't know. Why?
DILBERT: Because he was outstanding in his field!

BOSS: That's hilarious! Let's try another. Why was the math book sad?
DILBERT: Hmm, let me think... Because it had too many problems?

BOSS: Brilliant! We're making huge progress here!
DILBERT: Alright, let's see if our AI can add to our collection. Hey AI, tell us a joke.

DILBERT: Why did the tomato turn red?
BOSS: I have no idea. Why?

BOSS: Because it saw the salad dressing!
DILBERT: That's a good one! I think our AI is learning from us.

BOSS: Yes, soon we'll have people lining up to hear our AI tell jokes!
DILBERT: Who knows, maybe it could even replace us as the office comedians.

BOSS: Ha, don't get too ahead of yourself now. We're still the funniest people here!
DILBERT: Agreed, but our AI is a close second.

BOSS: Hey, buddy! Are you busy?
DILBERT: No, sir. What can I do for you?

BOSS: I was just thinking about how bored I am. Do you have any exciting projects for me?
DILBERT: We're currently working on a new app that will teach you how to knit. It's called "Knitflix".

BOSS: Wait, are you serious?
DILBERT: Absolutely sir. It's a knitting tutorial app that also streams knitting-related movies and shows.

BOSS: Well, I've always wanted to learn how to knit. Sign me up!
DILBERT: Will do sir. Maybe you'll even make me a sweater someday.

BOSS: Hey now, don't get too cocky.
DILBERT: I'll try not to, sir. But I can't make any promises.

BOSS: Fair enough. You know, you may have a future in comedy.
DILBERT: That's not what my computer science degree says, sir.

BOSS: Well, maybe you should've gone to clown college instead.
DILBERT: I'll keep that in mind for my next career move.

BOSS: Glad I could be of help. Thanks for the laugh, buddy.
DILBERT: Anytime, sir. Back to work for me now.

BOSS: Same here. Have a good one.
DILBERT: You too, sir.

BOSS: Hey there, Dilbert! What's up?
DILBERT: Not much, just writing some code. You know, the usual stuff.

BOSS: Ah, coding. The art of turning caffeine into lines of code.
DILBERT: You've got that right.

BOSS: So, do you have any new projects coming up?
DILBERT: Yep, I do. I'm actually working on a top-secret project.

BOSS: Ooh, top-secret, eh? I don't know whether I should be excited or scared.
DILBERT: Definitely excited. It's going to be amazing.

BOSS: Well, I don't doubt that. You're the master of code, after all.
DILBERT: High praise from the boss.

BOSS: Hey, I know a good developer when I see one.
DILBERT: Are you saying you have a sixth sense about developers?

BOSS: You could say that. It's like spider sense, but for coding.
DILBERT: I think you should patent that.

BOSS: Oh yeah, because every boss needs a sixth sense for developers. That'll definitely sell.
DILBERT: You never know. Could be the next big thing.

BOSS: Hey, stranger things have happened. But for now, let's just focus on your top-secret project.
DILBERT: Sounds good to me. Let's make some magic happen.

BOSS: That's the spirit. Now, get back to coding. You've got caffeine to turn into lines of code.
DILBERT: Will do, boss.

BOSS: Hey, Dilbert! You know, I was just thinking how I could make your job a little more interesting.
DILBERT: Oh?

BOSS: Yeah, you know how you're always working on those coding projects? Well, I was thinking we could spice it up a little bit.
DILBERT: Do tell.

BOSS: How about we code in some jokes or funny comments into the program?
DILBERT: That could be fun!

BOSS: I'll even let you add some of your own favorite jokes in there.
DILBERT: Oh man, this is gonna be great! I already have a few puns in mind.

BOSS: Glad to see you're on board. Just remember, we're not responsible for any laughing-related injuries.
DILBERT: Will do, boss!

BOSS: Dilbert, we need you to develop new software that will revolutionize the industry.
DILBERT: Oh, great. No pressure boss. I'll just create an entirely new product that will completely change the game.

BOSS: Exactly, we need to shake things up and show our competitors who's boss.
DILBERT: I think I have an idea. How about we create a program that will automatically change your boss's voice to a chipmunk whenever they try to micromanage you?

BOSS: I like it! That will keep me from being too overbearing.
DILBERT: And we can call it "ChipmunkMPower". It will be a hit!

BOSS: Brilliant! I'm already thinking of ways to market it. We'll be rolling in the dough.
DILBERT: Who said work can't be fun?

BOSS: Dilbert, how's the software development going?
DILBERT: Oh, it's a real joy. I can hardly contain my excitement.

BOSS: That's great to hear! Is everything on schedule?
DILBERT: Schedule? What schedule? I thought we were just flying by the seat of our pants.

BOSS: Dilbert, you always have such a great sense of humor!
DILBERT: Thanks. I'll be here all week.

BOSS: Well, in all seriousness, the client is anxious to see results. Can we expect it soon?
DILBERT: Sure thing, boss. Just like we can expect flying pigs and unicorns to be roaming the halls any minute now.

BOSS: That's the spirit, Dilbert! Let's aim for the impossible and see where it takes us.
DILBERT: You got it, boss. I'll start working on programming those unicorns immediately.

BOSS: Sounds good to me. Keep up the good work, Dilbert.
DILBERT: Yes, because programming mythical creatures is such a breeze.

BOSS: Dilbert, we need to develop a new software program that can predict the weather accurately.
DILBERT: Oh sure, because programming is basically magic. We can just develop a software that can control the weather instead.

BOSS: No, I just want something that can predict it, Dilbert.
DILBERT: Well in that case, we'll just need to collect some weather data, analyze it and then use some fancy algorithms to predict the weather. Easy peasy.

BOSS: Great, let's get started on it then!
DILBERT: Yes, because developing a software that can predict the future has never been easier. We'll just need to consult our crystal ball and voila! Accurate weather predictions at your service.

BOSS: You always know how to make me laugh, Dilbert.
DILBERT: Glad I can be of service, boss. Now let's go work our magical programming skills!

BOSS: Hey Dilbert, how's the software development going?
DILBERT: Oh, it's going great boss. Just the usual - crashing, freezing, and causing headaches for our users.

BOSS: Good to hear things are on track then. 
DILBERT: Of course! What's the point of software if it doesn't cause chaos and confusion?

BOSS: That's exactly right Dilbert. We want our users to be confused and frustrated. 
DILBERT: Exactly! We should add a mandatory 30-minute training session just to make sure nobody knows how to use it.

BOSS: Brilliant idea Dilbert! We can call it "How to Properly Navigate Through Our Mess of a Software."
DILBERT: And don't forget the daily reminder emails to let everyone know the software is still causing problems. 

BOSS: Absolutely! We want to keep our users on their toes.
DILBERT: That's the spirit boss. Our software may never be perfect, but at least we can have a good laugh about it.

BOSS: Dilbert, I heard that the software development team is taking longer than expected to finish the project. What's the status?
DILBERT: Oh, you know how it is boss. Software development is like cooking a turkey. You can't rush perfection.

BOSS: What do you mean?
DILBERT: Well, you can try to cook a turkey faster, but it will end up dry and tasteless. Similarly, if we rush the software, it will be full of bugs and glitches that will cause more problems later.

BOSS: I see your point, but we need to meet our deadline.
DILBERT: No worries, boss. We'll deliver it on time. We'll just work smarter, not harder.

BOSS: How can we work smarter?
DILBERT: Easy, we'll just add more developers to the team! More cooks in the kitchen always lead to faster cooking times, right?

BOSS: I don't think that's how it works.
DILBERT: Well, it's worth a shot. Or we could just start sacrificing some quality for the sake of time. We can always fix it later with updates, right?

BOSS: What! No, we can't do that!
DILBERT: I'm just kidding, boss. We'll figure it out and deliver it on time with the best quality possible. Just trust us.

BOSS: Alright, Dilbert. I trust you and the team. Just don't cook up any more turkey analogies, okay?
DILBERT: No promises, boss.

BOSS: Hey Dilbert, can you please tell me how to debug this software?
DILBERT: Sure boss, let me just put on my magical debugging goggles and presto, all the bugs disappear!

BOSS: Oh wow, that's amazing! I had no idea we had such advanced technology.
DILBERT: Yep, our software development team is always ahead of the game. We're like the Elon Musks of programming.

BOSS: Well, I wouldn't go that far, but I'm definitely impressed. Thanks for your help Dilbert.
DILBERT: Anytime boss, just don't forget to clap your hands three times and say 'debug, debug, debug' for good luck. Works every time.

BOSS: Dilbert, we need you to develop a software that can read our minds.
DILBERT: Sure, boss. I'll just need to get a degree in telekinesis first.

BOSS: Oh, you're a funny one, Dilbert. But really, can you make it happen?
DILBERT: Absolutely, boss. And while I'm at it, I'll also develop a software that can make coffee and do laundry.

BOSS: Now, now. Let's not get too crazy. But seriously, can you make that mind-reading software a priority?
DILBERT: Sure thing, boss. I'll just need a few brain scans from the staff to get started.

BOSS: Oh, Dilbert. You always know how to make me laugh. But on a serious note, can we expect that software soon?
DILBERT: I'll get right on it, boss. Just as soon as I learn how to read minds and bend spoons with my thoughts.

BOSS: Dilbert, I need you to develop a new software program for our company.
DILBERT: Sure, Boss. What kind of program are we looking at?

BOSS: Well, I want it to be the best and most advanced software out there.
DILBERT: Ah, I see. Do we have any specific requirements?

BOSS: Yes, I want it to have all the bells and whistles, and it should be able to do everything that our competitors' software can't do.
DILBERT: So basically, you want a unicorn?

BOSS: Exactly! I want a unicorn software.
DILBERT: Alright then, I'll get right on it. Let me just grab my magic wand and fairy dust.

BOSS: You're funny, Dilbert.
DILBERT: I know, Boss. I'll have that unicorn software ready for you next week.

BOSS: Great! And by the way, can you make sure it can also make me a cup of coffee?
DILBERT: Sure thing, Boss. And maybe it can also play the guitar and sing you lullabies.

BOSS: Now you're just being silly, Dilbert.
DILBERT: Oh, sorry Boss. I forgot that unicorns can't play guitar. Silly me.

BOSS: give me the name of any famous person.
DILBERT: sandra bullock.
